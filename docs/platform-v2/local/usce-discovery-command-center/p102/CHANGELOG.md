# P102 Changelog

Sprint-by-sprint history for the P102 (National Medical Opportunity Extractor) framework. Branch: `local/p102-claim-extraction-layer`. Production main at `739ab1e` UNCHANGED throughout.

## P102-0AC — 2026-05-13 — Sitemap candidate keywords as JSON

- Added `specs/p102_sitemap_candidate_keywords.json`: ~80 URL substring keywords used by sitemap-index recursion to filter candidate URLs. Pure data; runner will ingest in future.

## P102-0AB — 2026-05-13 — Cross-validator dispatcher

- Added `scripts/p102-validate-all.ts`: runs all 10 P102 validators (tsc, test-p102, validate-p102, validate-no-secrets, anti-drift, concept-packs, run-integrity, identity-registry, gold-set-verify, validate-p101) in sequence and aggregates into a single PASS/FAIL.
- Initial run: 9/9 PASS in 9.6s (skipping tsc with --fast).
- Recommended single command before any P102 commit.

## P102-0AA — 2026-05-13 — Identity registry → JSON config + parity validator

- Added `docs/.../p102/specs/p102_identity_registry.json`: 33 multi-campus systems + 20 known standalones + 1 special case (Hartford Hospital → Hartford HealthCare). Human-editable source of truth; the TS module is hand-mirrored.
- Added `scripts/p102-validate-identity-registry.ts`: parses the TS source (regex extraction, no eval) and confirms parity with the JSON registry. Validates system names, system domains, domain tokens, campus keywords, and standalone list.
- Initial parity check: PASSED (33 systems / 20 standalones match exactly).

## P102-0Z — 2026-05-13 — Run-folder integrity validator

- Added `scripts/p102-validate-run-integrity.ts`: deeper I/O checks beyond the main validator. Verifies (a) every accepted source's cleanedTextPath + rawHtmlPath exists on T7, (b) stored sha256 hashes match actual file hashes, (c) every claim's sourceUrl back-references its source_map entry, (d) every claim's cleanedTextPath exists and hash matches, (e) artifact-manifest paths exist.
- Initial run across 4 existing P102 runs: **PASSED (0 FAIL, 0 WARN)**. Full hash chain intact end-to-end.

## P102-0Y — 2026-05-13 — Concept-pack synonym lexicon JSON + sync validator

- Added `docs/.../p102/specs/p102_concept_packs.json`: 9 concept packs (observership, visiting student, research, shadow/volunteer, negative-strong, negative-medium, GME-future, jobs/visa-future, services-future) with synonym patterns.
- Added `scripts/p102-validate-concept-packs.ts`: compiles every pattern, checks regex validity, and confirms JSON ↔ lib parity. Initial run: PASSED (0 warnings).

## P102-0X — 2026-05-13 — Source-family registry as JSON config

- Added `docs/platform-v2/local/usce-discovery-command-center/p102/specs/p102_source_family_registry.json`: external JSON config defining URL/title keyword → sourceFamily mappings with priorities.
- Added `classifySourceFamilyFromRegistry()` to extraction-lib. Pure function; loads registry, returns lowest-priority match.
- Tests: 7 assertions for the registry classifier. 123 total assertions PASSED.

## P102-0W — 2026-05-13 — Test fixture expansion + canonicalizer bug fixes

- Test fixtures expanded by 17 assertions covering smart quotes, accented characters, multi-line quotes, dense nav chrome, deeply-nested boilerplate, no-`<main>` fallback, multi-space normalization, long-name identity inference, real-world robots.
- 2 canonicalizer bug fixes surfaced and patched:
  - `domainMatches` used substring matching → 'hca' inside 'healthcare' wrongly matched HCA Healthcare for unrelated domains. Fix: exact host or subdomain match.
  - System membership required name to include a known campus keyword. Failed for "Stanford Health Care" on stanfordhealthcare.org. Fix: when domain strictly matches a system's domain, treat as system member regardless of name match.

## P102-0V — 2026-05-13 — Source-claim provenance tracer

- Added `scripts/p102-trace-claim.ts`: given a claim ID, walks backwards through the run folder + T7 artifacts and prints the full provenance chain (claim, source, cleaned text + sha256 verification, raw HTML, JSON-LD, A3 gate context). Has `--list` mode to enumerate all claims by run.

## P102-0U — 2026-05-13 — P102 section in AGENTS.md

- Added a P102 section to `AGENTS.md` (the canonical agent-instruction file) pointing future sessions to the runbook, changelog, dashboard, doctrine. Lists 8 binding P102 rules, 5 validators to run before any P102 commit, pending sprints, and the trust-engine relationship.

## P102-0T — 2026-05-13 — Universe inventory tool

- Added `scripts/p102-universe-inventory.ts`: reads P101 packets + P102 runs, emits `P102_UNIVERSE_INVENTORY.md` + `specs/p102_universe_inventory.json`.
- Current state: 56 institutions tracked (55 P101 packets + 4 P102 runs, with overlap), ~0.93% of estimated 6000-institution USCE-relevant universe. 0 with PUBLIC_SAFE_USCE (correct under deterministic baseline).

## P102-0S — 2026-05-13 — Anti-drift validator + CHANGELOG

- Added `scripts/p102-anti-drift-validator.ts`: scans P102 docs for stale references — missing scripts, missing run folders, non-existent git commits, banned placeholder strings, schemaVersion drift, dead scripts. Exit 0 if clean, non-zero if real drift found.
- Added `docs/platform-v2/local/usce-discovery-command-center/p102/CHANGELOG.md` (this file).
- Anti-drift validator result: PASSED with 2 warnings (about scripts that hadn't been doc-referenced yet — fixed by this CHANGELOG).

## P102-0Q — 2026-05-13 — Gold-set verifier framework + machine-readable expected outcomes

- Added `docs/platform-v2/local/usce-discovery-command-center/p102/specs/P102_GOLD_SET_EXPECTED_OUTCOMES.json`: machine-readable expected outcomes per gold-set institution.
- Added `scripts/p102-gold-set-verify.ts`: compares actual gold-set run results against expected outcomes. Currently a skeleton (all 11 institutions return AWAITING_RUN until the gold set is authorized to run).
- Queue-to-expectations cross-check: clean.

## P102-0P — 2026-05-13 — Robots.txt URL filter in runner

- Added `isPathDisallowedByRobots()` to extraction-lib.
- Wired the runner to skip fixed-path probes that robots.txt disallows. Special case: `Disallow: /` + `Allow: /` (Hartford-style) is treated as permissive.
- Tests: 99 passing (added 9 for robots filter).
- Dormant until next A0 (extraction held).

## P102-0N — 2026-05-13 — Identity registry expansion (10 → 26 systems)

- Added 16 major US health systems to SYSTEM_REGISTRY: Atrium, Banner, Kaiser Permanente, Sutter, Tenet, CommonSpirit, Providence, Ascension, Trinity, UPMC, Geisinger, Sentara, Inova, BJC, Henry Ford, Corewell, Stanford Health Care, UCSF Health, UCLA Health, Memorial Hermann, Texas Health Resources, Wellstar, Piedmont.
- Refined KNOWN_STANDALONES to remove ambiguous system-member entries.
- Tests: 90 passing (added 13).

## P102-0M — 2026-05-13 — Cross-run dashboard

- Added `scripts/p102-generate-dashboard.ts`: aggregates A3 verdicts + claim counts across all P102 runs into `P102_DASHBOARD.md`.
- Discipline integrity checks: all 4 runs attest networkUsed=false + agentUsed=false; all claims quote-verified; 0 PUBLIC_SAFE_USCE under deterministic baseline; 0 false PUBLIC_SAFE_NO_PUBLIC_OPPORTUNITY.

## P102-0L — 2026-05-13 — Per-run report generator

- Added `scripts/p102-generate-run-report.ts`: reads every artifact in a run folder and emits a single-page `RUN_REPORT.md` per run.
- Generated for all 4 existing runs.

## P102-0K — 2026-05-13 — JSON-LD claim extractor + discovered-URL collector

- Added `scripts/p102-jsonld-claim-extractor.ts`: parses captured JSON-LD records into structured claims classified by `@type`. Captures discovered off-domain URLs (e.g., separate careers domain) as A4 candidates.
- Houston Methodist's careers page revealed `houstonmethodistcareers.org` as a separate careers domain via JSON-LD Organization record.
- All claims (when richer JSON-LD exists in future runs) will carry `extractionSource: 'JSON_LD'`.

## P102-0J — 2026-05-12 — Operating runbook + per-institution candidate-path generator + audit

- Added `docs/platform-v2/local/usce-discovery-command-center/p102/P102_OPERATING_RUNBOOK.md`: comprehensive operational reference.
- Added `scripts/p102-suggest-candidate-paths.ts`: recommends additional URL paths to probe for a given institution.
- Added `P102_INFRASTRUCTURE_AUDIT_2026_05_12.md`: end-of-period audit.

## P102-0I — 2026-05-12 — Concept-pack expansion + sitemap-index recursive parser

- Concept patterns expanded across observership (+5), VSM (+6), strong-negative (+5), medium-negative (+5), GME (+5), jobs/visa (+4).
- Added `parseSitemapXml()` to extraction-lib; runner now recurses into child sitemaps (bounded to 10) when root is a sitemap-index.
- Re-extraction: 50 → 65 claims across existing 4 runs, all FUTURE_LANE_ONLY or HUMAN_REVIEW_REQUIRED, all quote-verified.

## P102-0H — 2026-05-12 — Gold-set spec + identity canonicalizer + dedupe index backfill

- Added `P102_GOLD_SET_SPEC.md` with 10+1 institution benchmark covering known failure modes.
- Added `queues/p102_gold_set_queue.csv` (status=DO_NOT_RUN_UNTIL_P102_0D on every row).
- Added `scripts/p102-identity-canonicalizer.ts` with 10 known multi-campus systems + 8 standalones.
- Added `scripts/p102-backfill-canonical-institution.ts`: backfills existing runs' canonical_institution.json with inferred parent_system; populates T7 `dedupe_index.csv` with pairwise comparisons.

## P102-0G — 2026-05-12 — A4 focused-recovery + A5 continue-if-stuck

- Added `scripts/p102-a4-focused-recovery.ts`: enumerates structured recovery tasks (REFETCH_FAILED_SOURCE, EXPAND_FIXED_PATHS, INVESTIGATE_REDIRECT, ADD_CAMPUS_APPLICABILITY_PROOF, HUMAN_REVIEW_VOLUNTEER_PAGE, RECLASSIFY_SOURCE_FAMILY, RECOVER_EMPTY_SITEMAP, INCREASE_PROBE_DEPTH). Network-on-hold.
- Added `scripts/p102-a5-continue-if-stuck.ts`: evaluates per-stage completeness, emits recommended next action.
- Hartford → 1 A4 task (EXPAND_FIXED_PATHS); other 3 runs → 0 tasks. All 4 RUN_COMPLETE per A5.

## P102-0F — 2026-05-12 — Cleaned-text v2 extractor + content-based reclassifier

- Added `htmlToTextV2()` to extraction-lib: strips `<nav>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<aside>`, role-based nav blocks, and class-/id-based boilerplate; focuses on `<main>` / `<article>` when present.
- Added `reclassifySourceFamilyByContent()`: downgrades URL-classified families when content lacks expected keywords.
- Added `scripts/p102-recleantext.ts` diagnostic: applies v2 to existing raw HTML, writes T7 sidecar at `cleaned_text_v2/`, emits per-run diagnostic JSON.
- Findings: v2 cleaned text is 43–60% of v1 size (boilerplate removed); Houston `/observership` and 13 Brooklyn GME sub-pages reclassify to OTHER based on content.

## P102-0E — 2026-05-12 — Test suite + scope-inference bug fix

- Added `scripts/p102-extraction-lib.ts`: pure-function library extracted from the runner for unit-testability.
- Added `scripts/test-p102.ts`: 49-assertion test suite (later grown to 99).
- **Bug fix**: `inferSourceScope` previously treated generic medical-institution tokens ("hospital", "center", "medical", "health", "system", "university", "college", "group") as campus differentiators. Fix added `GENERIC_INSTITUTION_TOKENS` filter + tightened heuristic to require both a positive specific-token domain match AND a missing campus-specific token. Acronym domains like `tbh.org` now correctly default to INSTITUTION_SPECIFIC.

## P102-0C — 2026-05-11 — Claim extraction + quote verification layer

- Added `scripts/p102-extract-claims-from-run.ts`: deterministic concept-detector claim extractor.
- Added `scripts/p102-regate-run.ts`: hostile A3 re-gate (network-free, agent-free, run-folder only).
- Extended `scripts/validate-p102-discovery-runner.ts` with quote-verifier and visibility rules.
- Reader prompt captured at `specs/P102_A1_A2_READER_PROMPT.md` for future P102-0D model reader.
- All 4 existing runs re-extracted: 50 claims, all quote-verified, 0 PUBLIC_SAFE_USCE.

## P102-1 Trial 2 — 2026-05-11 — Three-institution dry run

- Ran Houston Methodist Hospital, The Brooklyn Hospital Center, AdventHealth Orlando.
- A3 verdicts all PASS_WITH_CAVEATS, networkUsed/agentUsed false, publicSafe false.
- Houston Methodist's `/observership` discovered to be a Pharmacy Externship redirect (real finding).

## P102-0B — 2026-05-11 — +5 fixed paths

- Extended FIXED_PATHS with `/health-professionals`, `/medical-education`, `/professional-education`, `/student-affairs`, `/education`.

## P102-0R — 2026-05-11 — Initial framework + Hartford Trial 1

- Built the deterministic control system: A0 probe → A1 broad → A1.5 audit → A2 skeleton → A3 hostile gate.
- Master spec, data contracts (11 schemas), operating doctrine (30 rules).
- Trial 1: Hartford Hospital → 2 accepted sources, A3 PASS_WITH_CAVEATS.
